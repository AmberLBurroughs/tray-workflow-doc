Written exercise:
- Talk about multiple ways to implement the same workflow
- Mention could have setup separate Slack notifications in each branch, but since all messages are the same you setup Slack once for simplicity specific to this.
- If you wanted to do specific actions after the Slack notification, could move the Slack alert into each branch and then add additional actions into each branch
- Talk about how you didn't have access to the Tray.io platform, would have done more thorough testing and provided more accurate details around setting up the workflow
- If you had full access to Salesforce and Tray: would also do more testing, and show more screenshots/examples/proper outputs in Slack of messages being sent
- Also mention any additional longer term goals or room for improvement
